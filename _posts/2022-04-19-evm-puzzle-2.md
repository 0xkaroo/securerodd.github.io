### Challenge:
Our second challenge is located in /puzzles/puzzle_2.json. Challenge 2 contains the following:
```
{
  "code": "34380356FDFD5B00FDFD",
  "askForValue": true,
  "askForData": false
}
```

<details>
<summary> Hint 1:</summary>
<br>
<div markdown="1">
```
The corresponding EVM opcodes are:

CALLVALUE	
CODESIZE	
SUB	
JUMP	
REVERT	
REVERT	
JUMPDEST	
STOP	
REVERT	
REVERT

```
</div>
</details>


<details>
<summary> Hint 2:</summary>
<br>
<div markdown="1">
```
CALLVALUE takes the value of the current call in wei
and places it on top of the stack. 
CODESIZE takes the size of the code 
and places it on the top of the stack.
SUB subtracts the second value on the stack
from the value on the top of the stack.


How can we JUMP over the 2 REVERT 
opcodes and land on the JUMPDEST?

The CODESIZE is 10 or a in Hex


1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a
34 38 03 56 FD FD 5B 00 FD FD
```

<summary> Hint 4:</summary>
<br>
<div markdown="1">
```

CALLVALUE   //Offset 0
CODESIZE    //Offset 1
SUB         //Offset 2
JUMP	    //Offset 3
REVERT	    //Offset 4
REVERT	    //Offset 5
JUMPDEST    //Offset 6
STOP	    //Offset 7
REVERT	    //Offset 8
REVERT      //Offset 9

```

To solve this level, we just need to pass in a value of 4 
wei. This way CALLVALUE places 4 on the top of the stack.
CODESIZE will then push 'a' to the top of the stack. 
SUB will subtract 4 from 'a' and push 6 to the top of the stack 
and JUMP performs a valid jump over the REVERT calls to JUMPDEST.
