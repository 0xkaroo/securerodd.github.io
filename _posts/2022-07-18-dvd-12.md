### Challenge:
Our twelfth challenge is called 'climber' and it comes with the following prompt:

```
There's a secure vault contract guarding 10 million DVT tokens. The vault is upgradeable, following the UUPS pattern.

The owner of the vault, currently a timelock contract, can withdraw a very limited amount of tokens every 15 days.

On the vault there's an additional role with powers to sweep all tokens in case of an emergency.

On the timelock, only an account with a "Proposer" role can schedule actions that can be executed 1 hour later.

Your goal is to empty the vault.
```

We have to find a way to take the funds from the vault and give them to the attacker.

The contracts for this challenge are located in contracts/climber/. The contract source code can be found below:

Which contract is an upgrade performed on in the UUPS design pattern? (Is it the proxy or the implementation? Which one is the ClimberVault?)

<summary> Solution:</summary>

<div markdown="1">
There are a couple of things we can gather both based on the prompt and a quick review of the code:

1. We can guess that the UUPS proxy patern will serve an important role in the solution
2. We will likely want to set the delay to 0 so that we can recover the funds in a single transaction
3. We want to do something to sweep the funds to our attacker

Keeping this in mind, we can dive deeper into the code and see that the ClimberTimelock allows anyone to execute an arbitrary command as long as it was already proposed. This is interesting. Further, we would be executing the commands from the context of the contract itself. What actions can we perform if we execute something that is proposed? We can see right away that we could now pass the requirement check and update the delay to 0. That's great now we would just need to find a way to be able to propose something. 

If we look at the constructor, we see that we are given self-administration and can therefore grantRoles to anybody. In other words, we can assign the PROPOSER role to anybody of our choosing. This is great, but even if we abused this to call `withdraw()` on the `ClimberVault.sol` contract, we would still be limited in the amount of funds we can collect and the `sweepFunds()` function can only possibly send funds to the designated sweeper. 

This is where the UUPS proxy comes in handy. The UUPS proxy is unique in that the implementation address holds the logic for contract upgrades. A very big issue with these contracts is that the owner of the proxy is the exact contract that we are executing our arbitrary code from. In other words, we have the permission to upgrade the proxy to a brand new implementation address.

So far we have the ability to call `execute()` which in turn gives us the ability to grant the proposer role and upgrade the contract to point to a new implementation. If we create a new implementation contract that allows us to sweep the funds to our attacker instead of to the current designated sweeper, then we would win! The only problem is.. we need to call `execute()` before we even propose a new rule because we need the delay to take effect before a new proposal is set. Luckily, we have one more bug we can exploit.

The contract suffers from a cross-function reentrancy bug because `execute()` checks that the commands being executed were already proposed AFTER they are actually executed. This means that we can create the proposal in the `execute()` call itself to propose what we are executing after it has already been executed. Voila!
