## Setting up the environment:

1. First things first, clone the EVM puzzles [repo](https://github.com/fvictorio/evm-puzzles). This contains all of the challenges we'll be going through to improve our understanding of EVM byetecode.
2. Get familiar with the tools we'll be using by reading through the hardhat [docs](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/) and playing around with [evm.codes](https://www.evm.codes)
3. Optional: Read and walkthrough 1st portion of noxx's EVM [series](https://noxx.substack.com/p/evm-deep-dives-the-path-to-shadowy?s=r)

### Challenge:
Our first challenge is located in /puzzles/puzzle_1.json. Challenge 1 contains the following:
```
{
  "code": "3456FDFDFDFDFDFD5B00",
  "askForValue": true,
  "askForData": false
}
```

<details>
<summary> Hint 1:</summary>
<br>
<div markdown="1">
```
The "code" section contains EVM bytecode. 
Try converting that to opcodes.
```
(one way is to drop the bytecode into [evm.codes](https://www.evm.codes/playground)) 
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary> Hint 2:</summary>
<br>
<div markdown="1">
```
The corresponding EVM opcodes are:

CALLVALUE	
JUMP	
REVERT	
REVERT	
REVERT	
REVERT	
REVERT	
REVERT	
JUMPDEST	
STOP

The goal of this challenge is to not cause a revert.
```

</details>


<details>
<summary> Hint 3:</summary>
<br>
<div markdown="1">
```
CALLVALUE takes the value of the current call in wei
and places it on top of the stack. 
JUMP takes the value on the top of the stack and moves
the program counter to the offset of that value.


How can we JUMP over the 6 REVERT 
opcodes and land on the JUMPDEST?
```

<details>
<summary> Hint 4:</summary>
<br>
<div markdown="1">
```
Each of the opcodes are 1 byte in size
```
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary> Hint 5:</summary>
<br>
<div markdown="1">
```
CALLVALUE //Offset 0	
JUMP	  //Offset 1
REVERT    //Offset 2	
REVERT    //Offset 3	
REVERT    //Offset 4	
REVERT    //Offset 5	
REVERT    //Offset 6	
REVERT    //Offset 7	
JUMPDEST  //Offset 8
STOP
```
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary> Solution:</summary>
<br>
<div markdown="1">
```
To solve this level, we just need to pass in a value of 8 
wei, so that CALLVALUE places 8 on the top of the stack 
and JUMP performs a valid jump over the REVERT calls to JUMPDEST.
```
