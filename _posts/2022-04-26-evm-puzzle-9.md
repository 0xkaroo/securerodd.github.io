### Challenge:
Our ninth challenge is located in /puzzles/puzzle_9.json. Challenge 9 contains the following:
```
{
  "code": "36600310600957FDFD5B343602600814601457FD5B00",
  "askForValue": true,
  "askForData": true
}
```

The corresponding EVM opcodes are:

CALLDATASIZE	
PUSH1	03
LT	
PUSH1	09
JUMPI	
REVERT	
REVERT	
JUMPDEST	
CALLVALUE	
CALLDATASIZE	
MUL	
PUSH1	08
EQ	
PUSH1	14
JUMPI	
REVERT	
JUMPDEST	
STOP

```

<summary> Hint 2:</summary>

We have 2 new opcodes here: LT and MUL.

LT checks that the value on the top of the stack
is less than the value directly below it on the stack.
It will place the result (1 for true or 0 for false)
on the top of the stack.

MUL multiplies the two values on the top of the stack
and places the result on top of the stack.

What should our calldata and msg.value be so that
we can pass both comparison checks and jump over all
of the REVERT opcodes?

<summary> Hint 3:</summary>

<div markdown="1">
```
Remember, CALLDATASIZE places the size of call data in bytes on the 
stack and CALLVALUE places the call value directly on the stack.

This one is pretty straightforward. We can see that we need our calldata
to be greater than 3 as we want the LT comparison to be true.

The second check we need to pass is we want our calldata * call value
to be equal to 8.

A solution to this is any 4 bytes of calldata and 2 wei for our call value.

Solution: 
calldata: 0xFFFFFFFF     call value: 2
