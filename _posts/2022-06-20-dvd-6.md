### Challenge:
Our sixth challenge is called 'selfie' and it comes with the following prompt:

```
A new cool lending pool has launched! It's now offering flash loans of DVT tokens.

Wow, and it even includes a really fancy governance mechanism to control it.

What could go wrong, right ?

You start with no DVT tokens in balance, and the pool has 1.5 million. Your objective: take them all.
```

So all we have to do is drain the lending pool!

The contracts for this challenge are located in contracts/selfie/. The contract source code can be found below:

The hints and solutions for this level can be found below:

<details>
<summary> Hint 1:</summary>
<br>
<div markdown="1">
Yet another flash loan. How can we abuse the flash loan to take over the governance? Hint: how are votes calculated?
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary> Hint 2:</summary>
<br>
<div markdown="1">
We can call the `snapshot()` function on the governance token at any time to record the balance of our attacker contract as well as the total supply.
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary> Hint 3:</summary>
<br>
<div markdown="1">
We can use the flash loan to queue up an action. When we later activate the action from our attacker contract, who is the `msg.sender` for the executed action?
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary> Solution:</summary>
<br>
<div markdown="1">
The flash loan allows us to temporarily borrow a huge number of governance tokens. During the flash loan, and while the governance tokens are still in our posession, we can call `snapshot()` to record the balance of our attacker contract and the current total supply. This is later used to check that we have enought votes to perform the `queueAction()`. We can now queue an action that will be a call to the `drainAllFunds()` function. With the action queued, we can repay our flash loan and wait the requried time of two days to execute our action. Notably, we will call into the governance contract in order to execute the action, which will in turn make an external call using our provided calldata (a call to the `drainAllFunds()` function). Whenever a regular (non delegating) external call is made, the `msg.sender` will be the calling contract. This is key, because this is how we can bypass the onlyGovernance modifier. Finally, `executeAction()` will call `drainAllFunds()` with the attacker address as a parameter and then all of the funds from the SelfiePool contract will be sent to the attacker and we have completed the challenge.
