### Challenge:
Our tenth challenge is called 'free rider' and it comes with the following prompt:

```
A new marketplace of Damn Valuable NFTs has been released! There's been an initial mint of 6 NFTs, which are available for sale in the marketplace. Each one at 15 ETH.

A buyer has shared with you a secret alpha: the marketplace is vulnerable and all tokens can be taken. Yet the buyer doesn't know how to do it. So it's offering a payout of 45 ETH for whoever is willing to take the NFTs out and send them their way.

You want to build some rep with this buyer, so you've agreed with the plan.

Sadly you only have 0.5 ETH in balance. If only there was a place where you could get free ETH, at least for an instant.
```

We need to find a way to borrow some ETH, use it to exploit the marketplace, and then pass over the NFTs to the buyer for our commission.

The contracts for this challenge are located in contracts/puppet-v2/. The contract source code can be found below:

<summary> Hint 1:</summary>

<div markdown="1">
First things first, how can we exploit the marketplace? There are multiple things wrong with the buy functionality.
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary> Hint 2:</summary>
<br>
<div markdown="1">
The first thing wrong with the buy functionality: it will send the proceeds not to the seller, but to the new owner of the NFT (hopefully you!).
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary> Hint 3:</summary>
<br>
<div markdown="1">
The second thing wrong with the buy functionality: the callvalue (msg.value) persists for the entire duration of the transaction. By calling the `_buyOne()` function inside of a loop, we are passing in the same msg.value to it each time. In other words, for 15 ETH we can buy all of the NFTs.

<summary> Hint 4:</summary>

<div markdown="1">
Now we need to find a way to borrow 15 ETH.

<div markdown="1">
Ok, so this one was a lot of fun! We can see that the only functionality offered in the marketplace is to either modify an offer or purchase an NFT. Since the offer modification function has access control protections, we can turn our attention to the buy functionality. The first big issue here is that the payment to the seller is actually not sent to the seller at all. It happens post NFT transfer, which means the owner of the NFT is now actually the purchaser. This is a huge bug, and this alone is enough to complete the level if we can borrow enough ETH to purchase the NFTS (because it will be sent right back!). But, we can do better. If we look closely, the msg.value check occurs within the `_buyOne()` function which is in turn called several times by the `buyMany()` function. This means that the callvalue or amount in msg.value will persist throughout the entire transaction. All NFTs for the price of one! With these two bugs, we can drain the contract and sell the NFTs to our buyer to pocket nearly 135 ETH total. 

The second thing we needed to figure out for this level was how we were going to receive a loan for the initial 15 ETH. When you look through the `free-rider-challenge.js` file, we see that there is a uniswap pair set up with WETH and DVT. Using this hint, we can see if a uniswap pair will allow us to borrow WETH (since we can unwrap it) for a flash loan. After a small bit of research, we can see that all swaps on uniswap pairs are actually flash swaps. In other words, by crafting our request in a particular way, we can absolutely borrow WETH and pay it back before the swap transaction finishes! With these two tidbits, we are able to make our exploit contract and beat the level.
